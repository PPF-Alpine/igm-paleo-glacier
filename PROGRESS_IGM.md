# IGM

## Background

IGM very good at taking data from oggm, wrapper to Randolph Glacier Inventory then adds climate/mass balance and topography data.

Mostly focused towards future projections

That's why we want to load paleo data customly into IGM.
    - Chelsa with PBCOR to get paleo climate data
    - GEBCO for topography data
    - EPICA for ice core data and delta T as a proxy for temperature
